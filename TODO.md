## URGENT: Carrier Tethering Bypass
- [ ] Merge FFI Knox bypass branch - BLOCKED: Need to handle uncommitted changes
- [ ] Enable tethering bypass immediately  
- [ ] Configure radio interface detection
- [ ] Deploy universal listener with POSIX peek
- [ ] Add packet fragmentation for DPI evasion
- [ ] Implement protocol obfuscation
- [ ] Test carrier bypass effectiveness

## Notes
- Carrier is clipping tethering - need immediate fix
- FFI branch has Knox bypass techniques ready
- Focus on working solution over perfect code
